        	<h1>Innovation is a necessary condition for the production of heavy-duty crushers Enterprise Development</h1>
			<div class="abouttext">
				<p>For any industry, if there is no innovation, then it is very difficult to grow in the crusher industry, too, if there is no innovation, its development will be very slow, this requires innovation, not only source in companies face increasingly complex external environment, as well as their own desire to want to grow and develop, and innovation is a necessary condition for any heavy duty crusher enterprise development.</p>
				<p>Now, the crusher industry in the face of the external environment is very complex, on the one hand many of the crusher equipment manufacturers, continue to emerge, especially in the national policy for the development of enterprises is to encourage the growing direction to the development of many enterprises provides a good opportunity, as in recent years, the prices of various raw material production are in constant state of growth, causing prices to rise in a straight line crusher, for small manufacturers, the acquisition cost is over high, which would greatly reduce the sales aspect of the crusher, as well as technical superiority of developed countries, their technological advantage is very obvious that their technology significantly more advanced than the technology of our country, which from one side inspire us to continue to strive to improve their technique.</p>
				<p>Such a severe situation, prompted our country crusher production enterprises to continuously promote the improvement of production technology, continuous technical innovation, the only constant innovation can not be defeated by the fierce market competition, occupy a certain market in the market share, we must accelerate the implementation of technical upgrading, the original old technology is bound to be replaced by new technology, adhere to rely on scientific and technological progress and innovation, improve production efficiency and product value, the progressive realization of the transformation and upgrading crusher industry to high-end industry-level forward, is the direction of enterprise development.</p>
