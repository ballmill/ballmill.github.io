        	<h1>SBM made full package service for FGM Sudan</h1>
			<div class="abouttext">
				<p>Recently, SBM signed a contract with Sudan FGM gold processing company. SBM will be responsible for the production line of the North Kurdufan in the middle-north Sudan, including the production line experiment, design, construction and maintenance. Furthermore, basing on the branch in Nigeria, SBM will dispatch operation and maintenance experts to the field of North Kurdufan to serve clients. Goods of the first round is scheduled to be shipped in the middle July.   According to the local report in South Africa, Sudan's yield of gold broke through 50 ton in 2012, with year-on-year growth of 48 percent, which makes it become the third largest gold producer. Historically, gold in Sudan has been mined for a long time, but the only procession of reselection wasted much resource and brought lower benefit. Moreover, due to the objective reasons of the strict and long examine and approve of the gold processing projects, the local investors have a higher requirement on the suppliers' capability of equipment production, mineral processing technology, equipment performance and ROI. </p>
			
				<p>Sudan's yield of gold broke through 50 ton in 2012   The cooperation between SBM and Sudan FGM began in 2011. FGM used HP220 production line, whose stability and high efficient made the yield exceed the expectation. Noah, sales manager of SBM's branch in Nigeria, paid a return visit to the client in 2012 and invited the client to China to have an on-spot investigation. In 2013, six people, manager and engineers, visited SBM. The both parties had a full discussion on the expected output, technology, investment risk and so on. "under the situation of relatively lower ore grade, we adopt the best technology, maximizing the indices of mineral dressing." said Noah. After client's visiting of the production base and field, we finally concluded the transaction. </p>
			
			<p>sudan FGM signed the contract with SBM   This cooperation covered Mineral experiment, technology support, installation and trial run and maintenance. Person in charge of SBM international market indicated "with the support of SBM technology and expert team, the production capacity will be enhanced and the return on investment will be shortened. Meanwhile, SBM will take advantage of the global experience in the similar project, providing FGM with a higher standard service.<br />
