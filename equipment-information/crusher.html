                    <p> Cone crusher is very popular in the mineral processing factory. It has the advantages of big crushing force, high efficiency, high processing yield, low cost, convenient adjustment, and economic use etc. Cone crusher is especially suitable for iron ore, quartz stone and other hard ore. By virtue of its sophisticated performance, cone crusher becomes more and more important in the iron ore production. It has gradually become the mainstream of crushing machine. </p>

                    <p> In the production line of stone processing, it will produce a lot of dust. These dusts not only pollute the environment, but also seriously harm people's health. So how to solve the dust problem is very necessary. If we know the reasons of crusher dust problem, then, we can find the solutions to solve this problem in the stone processing line. Now, we will discuss the reasons. Hope it will help you to solve your problems. </p>

                    <p>Impact crusher can be convenient and flexible adjustment of the material particle size, and has a wide regulating range. Impact crusher can go through a variety of ways to regulate the grain size, such as adjusting the rotor speed, adjust gap between the impact plate and the grinding cavity. Adjustment of the gap can be adjusted by mechanical or hydraulic. Hydraulic control system can be conveniently completed by local operation button or remote control system. </p>

                    <p>In the transmission path, we should reasonably design in general layout, such as using a barrier to prevent the noise transmission; the use of natural hills, slopes, forest, grass and so on; the use of sound source directivity characteristics to control noise. You can apply the high pressure boiler exhaust steam, oxygen making machine exhaust outlet towards the wilderness or the sky, to reduce the environmental impact.</p>
