    				Magnetic Separation Machine Common Faults And Solutions Analysis
Magnetic Separation Machine Common Fault

<p>Description: In recent years, the development of magnetic separation machine is very fast. Its development prospect is immeasurable. But inevitably, magnetic separators maybe have some problems in the use. So, how to solve these problems? The following is the common faults and solutions analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li>F: Magnetic separation machine's motor is overheating and has the abnormal sound.</li>
<li>S: The reason of this phenomenon may be three aspects: the lubrication of bearings is not good, or it is severe worn; the contact of switch circuit is bad; the voltage is too low. You can cheek the machine from these aspects. Then, solve the faults.</li>

<li>F: Magnetic separation machine's reducer is overheating.</li>
<li>S: You can cheek the machine from the following aspects: cheek whether the lubricating oil is lacking or the oil is bad; the gear and the worm are worn too much, or the mesh is not good; the bearing lubrication is bad, or it is worn seriously.</li>

<li>F: Magnetic field strength of magnetic separator is weak.</li>
<li>S:There are many factors to cause that the magnetic field strength become weak, such as, the temperature is too high; exposure to the sun; acid and alkali corrosion and so on. These all will lead to this fault. If the magnetic intensity of magnetic separation machine is declining, we can use the Gauss meter.</li>

<li>F: In operation, abnormal sound of magnetic separator. The cylinder does not rotate. And the bottom box is trembling.</li>
<li>S: Its reason is often that the cylinder is stuck by the bottom box's objects. Or the magnetic block is shedding, so that the cylinder body rattles. Seriously, it will cause the drum skin lacerate. At this time, it should be stopped for maintenance and troubleshooting.</li>

<li>F: Transmission gear is worn, and screw is loosening and dislocation.</li>
<li>S:The reason of this fault is obvious. You should stop working and repair the wear parts, and tighten the screw or replace them.</li>

<p>Find the fault reason, and solve the problem. In addition, remind the user that the magnetic separator equipment not only needs often maintenance, but also need regular repair, in order to reduce the equipment failure rate.</p>
