Vibrating Feeder Principle And Maintenance

<p>Description: In the crushing and grinding process, vibrating feeder is the important and essential machine. It can convey the material evenly and quantitatively. In the front of crusher and grinder, it needs to a vibrating feeder to convey the material into the machines. So you should the importance of vibrating feeder. For a machine, its operation and maintenance are vital. This will refer to its service life and economic benefits. Now, we will discuss them. Hope it is helpful for you.</p>

<h2>Vibrating Feeder Application</h2>
<p>In the sand production line, vibration feeder can feed continuously and uniformly into crushing machinery, and rough screening materials. It is widely used for the abrasive crushing and screening combination equipment in metallurgy, coal, mineral processing, building materials, chemical industry, and other industries.</p>

<h2>Vibrating Feeder Operation Principle</h2>
<p>Before starting, you need to do the preparation work. Check and eliminate between the body and the chute, spring and the bracket has no material and sundries to effect bodily movement. Carefully check whether all fasteners are fastened completely. Check whether the drive belt is good. Check whether the protective device is good. If have some unsafe phenomenon, it should be excluded.</p>
<p>After inspection, machine and transmission part is normal. Then you can only start. The machine is only allowed to start with no load. After the start, if there is abnormal phenomenon, you should stop immediately. Identify and eliminate the abnormal situation.</p>

<h2>Vibrating Feeder Maintenance Skills</h2>
<p>The maintenance and overhaul frequently is an important means to prolong the service life of the machine, and to ensure the normal work. The user should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The machine operator must pass the safety technical education, and be familiar with the operation of the machine. The feeder should be always checked the vibration amplitude, the motor current and motor surface temperature in the operation process.</p> 
<p>The lubrication of motor bearing is the key to the normal work of the whole feeder. This machine adopts the thin oil lubrication. Lubricating oil should be decided according to the use of location and climate condition. The operator must replace the lubricating oil every 3-6 months. When replacing, we should use gasoline or kerosene to clean the oil tank, the bearing raceway and gear surface.</p>
