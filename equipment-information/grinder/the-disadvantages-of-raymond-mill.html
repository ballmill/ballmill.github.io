    				The Disadvantages Of Raymond Mill, The Improvement Of Raymond Mill
The Disadvantages Of Raymond Mill

<p>Description: Raymond mill is one of the most widely used grinding equipment of powder processing. Raymond mill has the advantages of wide application range, convenient operation, simple equipment structure, the low price and other characteristics. These make it rapidly spread and enduring in China. However, with the rapid development of China's economy in recent years, and the rapid rise of emerging industries, the disadvantages and shortcoming of Raymond mill are increasingly exposed.</p>

<p>For the common grinding equipment—Raymond mill, what are the disadvantages?</p>

<p>First of all, the fineness of product is low. The powder size of the traditional Raymond mill is generally below 400 meshes. The development of new materials is more demanding on the powder product requirements. Powder products below 400 meshes do not meet the development requirements of new materials. The scope of its application is very limited. But the Raymond mill is only as rough machining equipment.</p>

<p>Secondly, the yield is low, and energy consumption is high. In recent years, the state has the increasing stringent requirements on energy saving and environmental protection. And it also clearly put forward the requirements of cleaner production to the enterprise production. The comprehensive performance disadvantage of the traditional Raymond mill in this aspect is increasingly prominent.</p>

<p>Although the traditional Raymond mill has a lot of disadvantages, it also has developing with the development of our society. Recently, many domestic scientific research units and manufacturers make many effective improvements to the traditional Raymond mill.</p>

<p>Through the improvement of the classification system, makes the Raymond mill to improve product fineness. The grinding roller and grinding ring are improved, which makes the product grinding efficiency is improved. At the same time, the service life of wearing parts is longer, and has convenient maintenance. Electric control cabinet centralized intelligent control and milling machine remote monitoring system, make the automation and information have higher degree. Equipment operation, maintenance and inspection are more safe and reliable.</p>

<p>On the basis of traditional Raymond mill, we conduct a large-scale innovation and improvement. Not only retains the advantages of traditional Raymond mill, but also adapt to the large-scale development requirements of domestic powder processing industry.</p>
