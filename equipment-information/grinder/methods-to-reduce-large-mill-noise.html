    					An Interview: What Are The Methods To Reduce Noise Of Large Mill?
Methods To Reduce Large Mill Noise

<p>Description: The noise problem has long plagued the user and equipment manufacturers. As everyone knows, the mill will produce a lot of noise in the working, especially for the large mill. Reducing mill noise has been an urgent problem to solve for all manufacturers. So, what are the methods to reduce noise of large mill? About this question, we interview the grinder expert—Mr. Wang. The following the detailed interview information.</p>

<ul>
<li>Host: Reducing the noise problem is our concern. Can you tell us what we should do?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Yes. I'm glad. If we want to solve the problem, we must know what the reason is. Noise is generated by the vibration of equipment. Most are due to the factors of the unbalanced wheels, and the machining error. In addition, it may be because of part material, equipment, and manufacture itself.</li>


<li>Host: So, if we know the reason, then, we can provide the corresponding solutions. What should we do?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: First of all, the equipment must be in accordance with the standard specifications for production. When the device is installed, we should accord to the standard steps of installation. We must that the equipment accuracy. In addition to the accident reason of equipment parts, lubrication system of the grinding mill is also an important reason. The lubrication system has the damping effect, and is also the important equipment to reduce the friction. </li>

<li>Host: As far as I know, the lubrication system can not only reduce the equipment noise, but also can reduce the friction, can't it?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Yes. You are right. Lubrication system is relatively important for the large mill. It can reduce the abrasion of equipment, and improve the service life of equipment. So, in your production process, you should pay attention to the parts' lubrication. I think if you do well the above methods, you can effectively reduce the noise of large mill, and can improve the work efficiency and the service life of the equipment.</li>


<li>Host: Oh. What a wonderful introduction! Thanks Mr. Wang to give us the methods to reduce the mill noise. Thank you!</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: You are welcome. I'm happy to take part in this interview.</li>
