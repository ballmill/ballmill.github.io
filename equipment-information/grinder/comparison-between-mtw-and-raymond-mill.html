    				An Interview: Comparison Between MTW Trapezium Mill And Raymond Mill
Comparison Between MTW And Raymond Mill

<ul>
<li>Host: We know that the Raymond mill has a long development history. Now, in the most of industries, we can also see its shadow. MTW trapezium mill, as the main equipment of mine crushing and industrial milling industry, is popular with the masses of customers. So, today we invite the grinder expert—Mr. Wang to tell the difference between MTW trapezium mill and Raymond mill. Welcome Mr. Wang!</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Good morning, everyone. I have study the MTW trapezium mill and Raymond mill for 20 years. I will try my best to solve your questions.</li>


<li>Host: Raymond mill is widely known by people in industrial milling industry. But maybe somebody is not familiar with its development process. So, can you introduce it for us, Mr. Wang?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Of course. In the mid of 1940s, the Raymond mill was introduced into China. Later, it became the most important grinding equipment in our grinding markets. Its use field has go throughout the powder processing industry, and be widely recognized by customers. Almost half a century later, in the late ninety's, on the basis of Raymond mill, China gradually appear the high pressure grinding machine, suspension mill and other modified products.</li>


<li>Host: Raymond mill is indeed so vital. It is said that it is the ancestor of the mill. Many grinders are developed on the basis of Raymond mill. So what about the MTW trapezium mill?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Compared with the traditional Raymond mill, MTW trapezium mill has a greatly changed in the composition. It has the dilute oil lubrication system with the modern technology, the curved duct with energy saving and environmental protection, without resistance volute design, reversed blade and the special structure of the grinding roller and grinding ring. All of these provide the absolute advantage for the MTW trapezium mill to surpass the traditional Raymond mill. The creative bevel gear drive and grinding roller linkage device let MTW trapezium mill play an unparalleled superiority in the field of modern industrial milling.</li>


<li>Host: Oh. The Raymond mill and MTW trapezium mill both are so good. Thanks Mr. Wang to give us a comparison between MTW trapezium mill and Raymond mill. We know more about them. Thank you, Mr. Wang!</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Not at all.</li>
