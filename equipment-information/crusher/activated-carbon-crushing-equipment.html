    				Introduction On Activated Carbon Application And Crushing Equipment
Activated Carbon Crushing Equipment

<p>Hello. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm you old friend. Do you remember me? People call me activated carbon. In your daily life, you can often see my shadow. If you pay attention to me, you will find that my application is very wide. If you are not familiar with me, please read the following introduction.</p>

<p>My application is in a variety of industries. In petrochemical industry, I am used to non-alkali deodorization, ethylene desalted water, catalyst carrier, water purification and sewage treatment. In the electric power industry, I am used for water treatment plant and protection. In the chemical industry, I'm the chemical catalyst and carrier, and used for gas purification, solvent recovery, and grease decolorization and purification. In the food industry, I am used for the food refining, decolorization, purification and deodorization. </p>

<p>If you have not heard the above application, you should know my use in the wastewater treatment. I have an important role in the environmental protection industry. I can be used for sewage treatment, waste gas and harmful gas purification and treatment. In fact, around your life, you can do it without me. For example, the new car usually contains many harmful substances and unpleasant pungent smell. If you use me, it can be effectively removed. I can absorb the formaldehyde and xylene in the room.</p>

<p>Next, I will tell you my crushing equipment. My brothers and sisters are not same. If you come across the big size activated carbon, you must crush them at first. So you will use the crushing equipment. Crushers have many kinds. It contains jaw crusher, impact crusher, cone crusher, hammer crusher, vertical shaft impact crusher and mobile crusher. And the mobile crusher also includes the hydraulic-driven track mobile plant, mobile jaw crusher, mobile cone crusher and mobile impact crusher. </p>

<p>My crushing equipment is diverse. You can accord to you production plant to choose the suitable machines. These models will meet you different demand. Now you must know more about my application and crushing equipment. This is my self-introduction about myself. Hope you have a deeper understanding about me.</p>
