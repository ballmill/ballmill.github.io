    				A Discussion About Hammer Materials Introduction Of Impact Crusher
Hammer Materials Introduction Of Impact Crusher

<p>Description: The hammer is the main crushing component of impact crusher. It directly contacts with the material, and is also the most severe wear part. So the hammer materials is relative important. This will decide the whole service life of impact crusher and the customer's economic benefits. Today, I will introduce three hammer materials: high manganese steel, wear resistant alloy steel, high chromium cast iron. The following is a discussion about them. Hope it is meaningful for you.</p>

<h2>Part1</h2>
<p>Hello, everyone. I think the high manganese steel material has its own advantages. Its application is much broad. When the hardness and strength of material are relatively high, it needs high toughness plate hammer material. Compared with wear resistant alloy steel and high chromium cast iron, the toughness of high manganese steel is the highest. In addition, its wear resistance is also better.</p>

<h2>Part2</h2>
<p>I also think that the high manganese steel's toughness is better. But the toughness is only one aspect. The hardness is also an important reference conditions. Compared with high manganese steel, the hardness of wear resistant alloy steel is higher. So the wear resistant alloy steel material is also a better choice.</p>

<h2>Part3</h2>
<p>Refer to the toughness, among this three materials, I think the high chromium cast iron material is the highest. So if we pay attention to the toughness, it should be a better material. </p>

<p>The above all are right. I agree with you. High manganese steel has 100 years of history. It has good toughness. But in strong impact, it also will occur work hardening. Alloy steel has high toughness and low cost, but also have good wear resistance and other advantages. But in practical application, the storage quantity is less, and can't meet the market needs. Although the high chromium cast iron has a long life, its toughness is not good, and relatively easy to fracture.</p>

<p>The above is about hammer board material of impact crusher introduction. Every material has its advantages and its disadvantages. Hope this introduction will be helpful for you.</p>
