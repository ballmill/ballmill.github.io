    			An Interview On The Role Of Hammer Crusher In Quartz Production Line
Hammer Crusher Role In Quartz Production

<p>Description: With the development of our infrastructure construction, hammer crusher's application is wider and wider. Its role is also more and more important in the industry. Quartz is one of the most widely distributed mineral, and its use is quite extensive, such as glass, casting, ceramics and refractories, metallurgy, construction, chemical, plastic, rubber, abrasive and other industries. Today, we will interview the expert—Mr. Wang about hammer crusher's role in quartz production. The following is the interview content.</p>

<ul>
<li>Host: We know that the quartz use is very wide. What is its use in the industry?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Quartz is one of the most widely distributed mineral, and its use is quite extensive. Quartz sand is an important industrial mineral raw material, which is widely used in glass, casting, ceramics and refractories, metallurgy, construction, chemical, plastic, rubber, abrasive and other industries. It can be used for the production of optical instrument, glasses, glass tube and other products. It also can do precision instrument bearings, grinding materials, glass ceramics and other industrial raw materials.</li>


<li>Host: Oh. Its application is so broad. We have a meaningful lesson. So what is the hammer crusher's role in quartz production?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Hammer crusher is an important machine in quartz production line. Its processing line usually contains the crushing process, grinding process, screening process, washing process and other process. As the vital crushing process, hammer crusher takes a huge task. </li>


<li>Host: I heard that quartz is divided into the ordinary quartz sand, refined quartz sand and high purity quartz sand. Can't they do without hammer crusher?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: No matter which kinds of quartz, they need the crushing process. If we want to produce different kinds of quartz stone, we need to use a variety of crusher equipment. Among them, the hammer crusher is essential. So it can be said that the hammer crusher has a non-replaceable role in the quartz production.</li>


<li>Host: Oh. Thanks Mr. Wang's wonderful introduction. This is a meaningful interview about the role of hammer crusher in quartz production. Thank you. Look forward to your next coming.</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Not at all. Hope to have the opportunity.</li>
