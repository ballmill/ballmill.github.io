    				A Discussion On Four Methods Of Gold Ore Separation Process In China
Gold Ore Separation Process In China

<p>Description: With so many gold ores in the world are mined, as one of the less developed countries, China also began its gold rich road. Gold ore dressing mainly includes gravity separation and flotation separation. Gravity separation method plays an important role in the gold production. Flotation is used widely for rock gold mine ore dressing method. In addition, there are the chemical processing method, and the heap leaching production process. The following is a discussion about the gold ore separation process.</p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p>Hello, everyone. We are not strange about the gold ore. Gravity separation is the oldest and the most common ways for gold ore separation process. It is also the main method with the most effective and the most economic. This kind method has been broadly applied in the small gold deposit and the local group mining.</p>

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>I don't agree with you. Gravity separation is rarely used alone, and not as a part of gold extraction process. I think the flotation is the better methods. At present, about 80% of China's gold mines use this method. Processing technology and equipment level have been greatly improved. It can handle the gold ore with high complex sulfide mineral. And the effect is most significant. </p>

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p>You are right. But for the coarse ore, I think the chemical processing method will be better. Chemical mineral processing technology includes gold amalgamation process, cyanide gold leaching process and leaching production process. Gold amalgamation process is an ancient extracting process. It is suitable for coarse monomer gold recovery. Many gold mines in China have also adopted this approach.</p>

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p>Facing the low grade oxidized ore, the heap leaching production process is proper. In China's gold resources, the low grade oxidized ore occupies a certain proportion. Treatment of this ore by conventional cyanidation is uneconomic. But there are economic benefits by using the heap leaching production process. It has the advantages of simple, easy operation, less investment, and good benefit. In the future, to further expand the heap leaching production scale is one of the ways to increase China's gold output.</p>
