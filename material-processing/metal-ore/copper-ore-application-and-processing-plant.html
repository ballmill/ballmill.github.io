    				Copper Ore Application, Copper Ore Equipment And Processing Plant
Copper Ore Application And Processing Plant

<p>Description: In a long time ago, China began to use the copper ware. There are many famous copper mine in our country. After beneficiation process, copper ore can become higher grade copper concentrate or copper ore sand. The copper ore is mainly applied in metallurgical industry, and as raw materials for metallurgical industry. With the wide application, the copper ore processing plant is more and more. They are all diverse. Today, I will introduce the copper ore processing plant.</p>

<h2>Copper Ore Application</h2>
<p>Copper is the earliest use metal. In the nature, the majority of copper exist in compounds of copper minerals. Copper is widely used in industry. It can be used in electrical, mechanical, vehicle, ship, building industry and civil appliances. At present, in the field of electrical and electronic industry, copper is mainly used in the manufacture of wire, communication cable and other products, such as motor, the rotor and electronic instruments, etc. Copper and copper alloy play an important role in computer chips, integrated circuits, transistors, printed circuit boards and other equipment device. In the construction industry, copper can be used for a variety of pipes, pipe fittings, decoration device etc.</p>

<h2>Copper Ore Production Equipment</h2>
<p>Copper ore processing equipment contains a lot of machines, such as crusher, grinder, vibrating screen, vibrating feeder, belt conveyor, sand washing machine, and beneficiation equipment. Crushers have many types, for example jaw crusher, cone crusher, impact crusher, hammer crusher, and mobile crusher. Grinders contain trapezium mill, vertical mill, ultrafine mill, ball mill and Raymond mill. Beneficiation machines have magnetic separation machine, flotation machine, spiral classifier, high-frequency screen, and hydrocyclone. When choose the machine configuration, you can select the best suitable equipment.</p>

<h2>Copper Ore Processing Plant</h2>
<p>Copper ore processing plant is diverse. Here, we introduce a common production line. Jaw crusher is the primary crushing machine. And impact crusher is as the second crushing machine. We select two stages crushing process. Of course, you can add an impact crusher, or form a three stages crushing process. After crushing, it turns to grind. We choose the SCM ultrafine mill to grinding fine copper power. Then, we use the vibrating screen to select the finished product with the suitable size. Afterward, by the magnetic separation machine and flotation machine, the copper ore complete the selection process.</p>
