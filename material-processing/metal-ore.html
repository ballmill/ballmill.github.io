                    <p>Iron ore is an important raw material of iron and steel production enterprises. Iron ore is the world's most common use metal. It is used in the various departments of national economy, and people's daily life. The beneficiation process of iron ore contains the crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, or gravity concentration process. The beneficiation equipment has magnetic separation machine, flotation machine, spiral classifier, high-frequency screen and so on. Today, we will discuss the iron ore application and beneficiation equipment. </p>

                    <p> With so many gold ores in the world are mined, as one of the less developed countries, China also began its gold rich road. Gold ore dressing mainly includes gravity separation and flotation separation. Gravity separation method plays an important role in the gold production. Flotation is used widely for rock gold mine ore dressing method. In addition, there are the chemical processing method, and the heap leaching production process. The following is a discussion about the gold ore separation process. </p>

                    <p> Manganese is widely distributed in nature. It is an indispensable raw material for iron and steel industry. Manganese is a strong reducing agent, and is also a kind of excellent desulfurizing agent. It can remove sulfur from steel water. With the increasing industries' application, manganese ore processing plant is more and more. Its equipment is also diverse. Here, we will introduce the manganese ore processing plant and the common production equipment. </p>

                    <p>In a long time ago, China began to use the copper ware. There are many famous copper mine in our country. After beneficiation process, copper ore can become higher grade copper concentrate or copper ore sand. The copper ore is mainly applied in metallurgical industry, and as raw materials for metallurgical industry. With the wide application, the copper ore processing plant is more and more. They are all diverse. Today, I will introduce the copper ore processing plant. </p>

                    <p>In the early, the hematite ore dressing general use the gravity separation process. The main machines have jigging machine, centrifugal separator, spiral chute, spiral concentrator, shaking table etc. In a long time, my ancestor uses this separation method. Afterward, this method is abandoned, because it has too many disadvantages. Treatment capacity is small. The grade is low. Ore dressing recovery rate is low. So it is gradually eliminated. </p>
