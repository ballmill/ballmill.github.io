    				Graphite Crusher In India, Graphite Crushing Machine & Crushing Line
Graphite Crusher In India

<ul>
<li>Host: In 1930s, our country started graphite's production and processing. At that time, the crushing and beneficiation process is simple. After decades of development, the crushing technology has significantly improved. Today, we will introduce the graphite crushing machine and crushing line in India. Welcome to our guest—Mr. Wang!</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Hello every! It's my pleasure to come here. Hope that you will be satisfied to the share.</li>


<li>Host: Welcome your coming again, Mr. Wang! We are more familiar with the graphite as the conductive materials. In our daily life, it is used in many industries, isn't it?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Yes, graphite's application is very wide. Except for the conductive materials, it also can be used as the refractory materials, as the wear-resistant lubricating material, as the high temperature metallurgical materials. It is an ideal sealing material. It is also widely used in petrochemical, hydrometallurgy, acid-base production, synthetic fiber, paper and other industrial departments, as well as the atomic energy industry and national defense industry. With the development of science and technology, graphite has developed many new uses. Not only in India, but also in the international market, its demand is increasing year by year.</li>


<li>Host: Wow. In the future, we may see the graphite's shadow for everywhere. Since its application is so wide, then can you relate its crushing machine and crushing line?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: I'm glad. The different production site will have the diverse machine configuration. Graphite crusher has many models. According to your production demand, you can choose jaw crusher, cone crusher, impact crusher and hammer crusher. Generally speaking, jaw crusher is the primary crushing equipment. Impact crusher is generally not as the primary crushing equipment, but can be as the secondary crushing machine. When graphite goes through the two crushing processes, it will be screened by the vibrating screen. Then, we can obtain the suitable graphite. </li>


<li>Host: The crushing machine has a lot of choices. So does the crushing line. Thanks Mr. Wang for giving us a wonderful share about the graphite crusher in India. It is meaningful for everyone. Thank you!</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: You're welcome. Thank you for the invitation.</li>
