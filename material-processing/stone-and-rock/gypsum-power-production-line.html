    				Gypsum Power Application, Gypsum Power Production Line And Equipment
Gypsum Power Production Line

<p>Description: Gypsum powder is one of the five gel materials, and occupies an important position in the national economy. It is widely used in construction, building materials, industrial mold and artistic model, chemical industry and agriculture, food processing and pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields. It is an important industrial raw material. In recent years, with the development of gypsum products industry, gypsum powder has become a scarce material. According to the different applications, the gypsum power production line is also diverse.</p>

<h2>Gypsum Power Application</h2>
<p>Application of gypsum has been a long time. With the rapid development of economy, the demand of architecture, building materials and other related industries increase sharply. Gypsum has aroused more and more attention, and has formed a new industry giant.</p>
<p>In the building materials industry, along with the increasing of high-rise buildings, gypsum powder can not meet the market demand. In the glass production process, gypsum powder can be used as the cosolvent and purifying agent. In plastic, rubber, paint, asphalt, and asphalt felt industry production, it is used as the filler. It is the main raw material of concrete expansion agent and anti-cracking agent. In agriculture, it can improve the soil and adjust the PH value.</p>

<h2>Gypsum Power Production Line Equipment</h2>
<p>According to the different use, the production equipment has many choices. The crushing machines can choose jaw crusher, cone crusher, impact crusher, hammer crusher, and so on. So is the grinding equipment. Here, we choose jaw crusher, cone crusher and LM vertical mill as the crushing and grinding machines. In addition, there are also vibrating feeder, vibrating screen, elevator, and belt conveyor.</p>

<h2>Gypsum Power Production Line</h2>
<p>The big gypsum stone goes through the jaw crusher for the primary crushing, and the cone crusher for the second crushing. Then, the gypsums with the suitable size enter into the LM vertical mill for grinding. After crushed and grinded, the big gypsum stones turn into the fine gypsum power. Through the screening action of vibrating screen, we can get the gypsum powder with required size. The gypsum powders which don't conform to the requirement will once again into the vertical mill for grinding.</p>
