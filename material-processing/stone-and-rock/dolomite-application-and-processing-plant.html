    				A Self-Introduction About Dolomite Application And Processing Plant
Dolomite Application And Processing Plant

<p>Hello. Good morning! I'm your new friend. My name is dolomite. I'm 20 years old. Glad to see you! Maybe someone doesn't know me. It's doesn't matter. The following is my self-introduction. Hope it will help you to know me.</p>

<p>I belong to carbonate minerals. In lacustrine sediments, gypsum, anhydrite, halite, sylvite and I are in intergrowth. They are my best friends. Don't look at my low status, because I have a big role in people's daily life. People can't live without me. </p>

<p>I can be used as the refractory inner layer of steelmaking, slagging agent, raw materials of cement, glass flux, ceramics, fertilizer, building and decorative stone, paints, pesticides and pharmaceuticals and other purposes. In some fields, you can see my shadow, such as building materials, ceramics, glass and refractory materials, chemical industry, agriculture, environmental protection, energy saving etc.</p>

<p>With my increasing application, my production and processing plant have more and more methods. Many professionals research the better processing plant. Now, I tell you my some processing methods. </p>

<p>My size is different. Our shape is diverse. So facing the big size, you must do the crushing process. We are generally crushed. Crushers have a lot of types. In generally, jaw crusher is the primary crushing machine. Sometimes it is the cone crusher. Impact crusher is usual as the secondary crushing machine. Cone crusher can also do it. You can base on your production demand to choose one stage crushing process or two stages crushing process. You can also use two or three crushers to increase the production capacity.</p>

<p>After crushing, we should be grinded by the grinder. You can select vertical mill, trapezium mill, ultrafine mill, or ball mill. When selecting, you can see the production status, the price, and its quality. After grinding, we need to be screened by the vibrating screen. You can select one layer or two layers. If you want to get two different size finished products, you should choose the vibrating screen with two layers. Then you will obtain the expected finished product.</p>

<p>This is all my self-introduction. It is mainly about my application and processing plant. Now, you must have a deep understand for me.</p>
