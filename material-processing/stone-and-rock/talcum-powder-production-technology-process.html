    				A Detailed Share About Talcum Powder Production Technology Process
Talcum Powder Production Technology Process

<ul>
<li>Host: Talcum powder is white, fine and no sand powder. Maybe we don't know much about it. So today we are honored to invite the expert—Mr. Wang to introduce the talcum powder and its production technology process. Welcome Mr. Wang!</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Hello everyone! It's my pleasure to come here. Hope that you will be satisfied to the share.</li>


<li>Host: we are familiar with the talcum powder used as the medicinal action. But it has many other applications, doesn't it?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Yes. Talcum powder's application is wide. In chemical industry, it can be used in rubber, plastic, paint and other chemical industries as the strengthening modified filler. In the ceramic industry, it can be used in the manufacture of high frequency porcelain, wireless electric porcelain, all kinds of industrial ceramics, architectural ceramics, ceramics for daily use and ceramic glaze etc. It also can be used for the additive of medicine and food industry, as well as a variety of high and low grades of paper industry products. In addition, it is the quality filler in cosmetics industry.</li>


<li>Host: Its use indeed is very wide. These industries' applications are strong for us. Since its use is so broad, so can you tell us its production technology process?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Of course. I'm glad. Talcum powder production technology process is similar, but its equipment configuration is diverse. For the crusher choice, you can choose jaw crusher, cone crusher, impact crusher and hammer crusher. Generally speaking, jaw crusher is the primary crushing equipment. Impact crusher is generally not as the primary crushing equipment, but can be as the secondary crushing machine. The grinding machines also have many choices. Such as the vertical mill, trapezium mill, ultrafine mill and so on. </li>


<li>Host: So facing these machines, How to configure the production equipment?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: According to the production demands and material property, you can choose the most suitable equipment. These models can meet a lot of demands on customers' production. After crushing and grinding process, under the screening action, it will be screened by vibrating screen. Then, we will complete the Talcum powder production technology process.</li>


<li>Host: This is a detailed share. Thank you, Mr. Wang!</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: You're welcome!</li>
