    				An Exciting Interview About Bauxite Crushing Production Line
Bauxite Crushing Production Line

<ul>
<li>Host: Bauxite is a kind of alumina ore. We know that because it often contains iron oxide, its color has yellow to red. Bauxite is the main raw material for smelting aluminum. Today we are honored to invite Mr. Wang to introduce the bauxite and its crushing production line. Welcome Mr. Wang!</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Thank you for your invitation. I'm glad to take part in this interview. Hope that it is helpful for you.</li>


<li>Host: As far as I know, bauxite is the best raw material for the production of metal aluminum, and is also its main application areas, isn't it?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: You can so said. That is indeed its main application. In addition, it can also be used in metallurgical industry, chemical industry, refractory material, abrasive materials, iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metals industry and cement industry. The bauxite, which is used in the manufacture of refractories, is called refractory grade bauxite. The most basic use is in the metallurgy department for the production of aluminium. For the market size and value, refractory bauxite occupies an important position in the non-metallurgical market.</li>


<li>Host: Originally, it is so widely used. Since it has so big need, can you tell the bauxite crushing production line for us?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Of course. I'm glad. For the crushing production line, I think the crushing equipment is the key. The number and configuration of crushers refer to the whole production line capacity and quality. So choosing the crusher model must be cautious.</li>

<li>Host: Crushers have a lot of models. Which model crusher is the most suitable?</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: Crushers have jaw crusher, cone crusher, impact crusher, hammer crusher and so on. According to your production demand, you can choose the crusher. Generally speaking, jaw crusher is the primary crushing equipment. Impact crusher is generally not as the primary crushing equipment, but can be as the secondary crushing machine. In addition, you need to pay attention to the machine's quality and price. This will refer to the production efficiency.</li>


<li>Host: That's great. After listening to this exciting interview, I understand bauxite and its crushing production line. Thank you, Mr. Wang!</li>
<li>Mr. Wang: You're welcome.</li>
