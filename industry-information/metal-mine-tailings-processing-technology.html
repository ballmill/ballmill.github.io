    				Three Kinds Of Metal Mine Tailings Processing Technology
Metal Mine Tailings Processing Technology

<p>Description: Tailings processing is an important part of the mine production. It is also a very important part in the construction and operation of mineral processing plant. The traditional processing method of Tailings surface stacking has many problems. The new technology of tailings disposal at home and abroad is continued to develop, and gradually obtains the industrial application. Today, we will introduce three kinds of metal mine tailings processing technology: tailings efficient dehydration, full tailings filling goaf, paste tailings dry piling.</p>

<h2>Tailings Efficient Dehydration</h2>
<p>Tailings thickening and dewatering is an important link of tailings disposal. In recent years, both at home and abroad, we have carried out extensive exploration in improving the tailing thickening efficiency and improving tailings concentration.</p>
<p>The representative is the application of combined condensed process, development of the new and efficient gravity dewatering equipment, and the application of tailing pressure filtration technique. The combined condensed process mainly combines hydraulic cyclone centrifugal sedimentation with gravity sedimentation.</p>

<h2>Full Tailings Filling Goaf</h2>
<p>Cemented filling technology has been widely used in mines at home and abroad. It is the use of classified tailings as mine filling material. But until 1980s, the technology of all tailings used as filling material caught more attention.</p>
<p>At present, there are two main methods of full tailings filling mined out area in China: full tailings cemented filling and high water consolidation tailing filling. On the one hand, the full tailings filling mined out area can make reasonable use of tailings waste. On the other hand, it can save tailing pond, and improve the environment of the mine. It has the economic, environmental, security and many other benefits.</p>

<h2>Paste Tailings Dry Piling</h2>
<p>Paste tailings dry piling is a kind of new tailings disposal methods developed in recent years. Its characteristic is that tailing after dehydration can dry piling on the surface, which can save the construction investment of conventional tailing pond.</p>
<p>The key of paste tailings dry piling is that tailing after dehydration can go up to quite high concentrations. In the stack, it will not happen segregation, electrodialysis little water, with some support strength, and can be naturally accumulated to form a ridge shaped with certain height. The method can be applied in the canyon, low-lying, flat, gentle slope and other terrain conditions.</p>
