    				Grinding Mill Promotes The Development Of Chinese Medicine Industry
Grinding Mill Promote Medicine Industry Development

<p>Description: Traditional Chinese medicine grinding is an important ring in its production process. So the grinding mill is very important for Chinese traditional medicine industry. Ultrafine mill is a new grinder for traditional Chinese medicine in recent years. Because its crushing fineness is extremely high, the application scope is broad in the drug research and clinical application. This kind of machine market is also in booming development. It can be said that ultrafine mill promotes the development of Chinese medicine industry.</p>

<p>Traditional Chinese medicine superfine mill adopts the high speed single-phase motor. It has the advantages of precise structure, small volume, light weight, high efficiency, no dust, clean, simple operation, beautiful shape, saving electricity and security etc. Its appearance makes that the drug production is more in line with national standards, to meet the requirement of GMP. So its development is inevitable.</p>

<p>Since the ultrafine comminution technology is conquered by domestic enterprises of science and technology, superfine mill's high price is quickly pulled low. At present, it has been widely applied in processing the ultrafine power of cordyceps sinensis, pearl powder, ganoderma spore powder, ginseng and other precious Chinese herbal medicines. It not only greatly improves the utilization rate of medicinal materials, but also greatly improves the medicine efficacy. It is well received by customers!</p>

<p>However, the valuable Chinese herbal medicines after grinding generally appear to the color problem. In general, the colors are becoming gray and dark. The researchers conduct a lot of experiments in the industry. They find that the reason of the color change is that after grinding, the powder fineness is large, and surface area increases. Then the reflectivity and reflection angle of light to the particles will change.</p>

<p>In addition, the traditional Chinese medicine's water content and physical properties change before and after processing. This can lead to discrepancies in color. Aiming at this problem, pharmaceutical companies increase investment in scientific research. They use the cold water machine integrated into the mill. This makes that the whole coordination of superfine mill reaches a high level, also solve the temperature problems in the grinding process.</p>

<p>At present, the grinder industry is fast to develop. Then, it will further promote the development of Chinese medicine industry. </p>
